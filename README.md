## Description 
> The motivation for DyVert derives from a lack of media search instruments that accurately cater to the interest of the consumer.
> With this app, our goals are to broaden the client's media/ entertainment palette and showcase the content of our creators to new consumers who share a common interest.
> 
> Our service will be in the form of a web app, giving users easy 24/7 access.
> The selling point of our app is to essentially give users a social platform that lets them find and save media items (movies, shows, books) that they may want to look into based on a preview shown on a content card.
>
>  Content creators will create cards for movies, shows, and books.
> 
> Users will see cards based on their content preferences. These users will be able to swipe (DyVert) media items right if they are interested in the items and want to save them, or  left if they are not interested.
> Once they DyVert, they will be able to add reviews for each card they added.
> 
> SysAdmins can monitor posts, they will be able to flag and delete content cards, as well as reviews and comments.
